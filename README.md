What is sudoku?
Sudoku is a number puzzle played over a 9x9 grid, divided into 3x3 sub grids called regions.
  - Each cell is indicated by its coordinates where capital letters(A-I) denotes row 
      and small letters(a-i) indicate column. 
  - Sudoku begins with some of the grid cells already filled with numbers.
  - The object of Sudoku is to fill the other empty cells with numbers between 1 and 9 
       (1 number only in each cell) according the following guidelines:
         1. Number can appear only once on each row.
         2. Number can appear only once on each column.
         3. Number can appear only once on each region. 
  - A summary of this would be, that a number should appear only once on each row, column and region.
 The more numbers that are removed, the harder the puzzle.
